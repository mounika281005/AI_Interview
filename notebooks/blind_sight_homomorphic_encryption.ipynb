    "# 🔐 Blind-Sight: Privacy-Preserving Analytics with Homomorphic Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Blind-Sight** - performing analytics on encrypted data without ever decrypting it during computation. We use **TenSEAL** library with the **CKKS** homomorphic encryption scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Homomorphic Encryption?\n",
    "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows computations on encrypted data:\n",
    "- **Encrypt** → **Compute** → **Decrypt** = Same result as computing on plaintext\n",
    "- Data remains private throughout the entire computation\n",
    "- Perfect for sensitive data analytics (healthcare, finance, interviews)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Demonstrate:\n",
    "1. ✅ Generate sample interview/salary dataset\n",
    "2. ✅ Encrypt the dataset using CKKS scheme\n",
    "3. ✅ Perform encrypted analytics (sum, average)\n",
    "4. ✅ Perform encrypted linear regression\n",
    "5. ✅ Decrypt and compare with plaintext results"

    "### 🎯 What We Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blind-Sight Analytics** using Homomorphic Encryption enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Privacy-Preserving Computation** - Analytics performed on encrypted data without exposing individual records\n",
    "2. **Secure Aggregation** - Sum, average, and regression components calculated without decryption\n",
    "3. **Verifiable Accuracy** - Results match plaintext computation within CKKS approximation bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔐 Security Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "| Property | Description |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Data Confidentiality** | Individual values never exposed during computation |\n",
    "| **Aggregate Analytics** | Only statistical summaries are revealed |\n",
    "| **No Trusted Third Party** | Computations can be outsourced to untrusted servers |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Use Cases for AI Mock Interview System\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Salary Benchmarking** - Compute market averages without exposing individual offers\n",
    "- **Performance Analytics** - Aggregate interview scores across companies privately\n",
    "- **Bias Detection** - Statistical analysis without accessing protected attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computational Overhead** - HE operations are slower than plaintext\n",
    "- **Multiplicative Depth** - Limited number of multiplications before noise grows too large\n",
    "- **Approximate Results** - CKKS provides approximate (not exact) arithmetic"
